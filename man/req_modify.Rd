\usage{
req_modify(
  req,
  ...,
  path = NULL,
  query = NULL,
  body = NULL,
  mime_type = NULL,
  method = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{req}{A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{path}{The route to an API endpoint. Optionally, a list or character
vector with the path as one or more unnamed arguments (which will be
concatenated with "/") plus named arguments to \code{\link[glue:glue]{glue::glue()}} into the
path.}

\item{query}{An optional list or character vector of parameters to pass in
the query portion of the request. Can also include a \code{.multi} argument to
pass to \code{\link[httr2:req_url]{httr2::req_url_query()}} to control how elements containing
multiple values are handled.}

\item{body}{An object to use as the body of the request. If any component of
the body is a path, pass it through \code{\link[fs:path]{fs::path()}} or otherwise give it the
class "fs_path" to indicate that it is a path.}

\item{mime_type}{A character scalar indicating the mime type of any files
present in the body. Some APIs allow you to leave this as NULL for them to
guess.}

\item{method}{If the method is something other than GET or POST, supply it.
Case is ignored.}
}

A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.
