\title{Parameters used in multiple functions}
\arguments{
\item{base_url}{The part of the url that is shared by all calls to the API.
In some cases there may be a family of base URLs, from which you will need
to choose one.}

\item{body}{An object to use as the body of the request. If any component of
the body is a path, pass it through \code{\link[fs:path]{fs::path()}} or otherwise give it the
class "fs_path" to indicate that it is a path.}

\item{case}{The case standard to apply. The possible values are
self-descriptive. Defaults to "snake_case".}

\item{depth}{The current recursion depth.}

\item{method}{If the method is something other than GET or POST, supply it.
Case is ignored.}

\item{mime_type}{A character scalar indicating the mime type of any files
present in the body. Some APIs allow you to leave this as NULL for them to
guess.}

\item{path}{The route to an API endpoint. Optionally, a list with the path
plus variables to \code{\link[glue:glue]{glue::glue()}} into the path.}

\item{query}{An optional list of parameters to pass in the query portion of
the request.}

\item{req}{An \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.}

\item{security_fn}{A function to use to authenticate the request. By default
(\code{NULL}), no authentication is performed.}

\item{security_args}{An optional list of arguments to the \code{security_fn}
function.}

\item{user_agent}{A string to identify where this request is coming from.
It's polite to set the user agent to identify your package, such as
"MyPackage (https://mypackage.com)".}

\item{x}{The object to update.}
