  base_url,
  path = NULL,
  query = NULL,
  body = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{base_url}{The part of the url that is shared by all calls to the API.
In some cases there may be a family of base URLs, from which you will need
to choose one.}

\item{path}{The route to an API endpoint. Optionally, a list with the path
plus variables to \code{\link[glue:glue]{glue::glue()}} into the path.}

\item{query}{An optional list of parameters to pass in the query portion of
the request.}

\item{body}{An object to use as the body of the request. If any component of
the body is a path, pass it through \code{\link[fs:path]{fs::path()}} or otherwise give it the
class "fs_path" to indicate that it is a path.}

\item{mime_type}{A character scalar indicating the mime type of any files
present in the body. Some APIs allow you to leave this as NULL for them to
guess.}

\item{method}{If the method is something other than GET or POST, supply it.
Case is ignored.}

\item{security_fn}{A function to use to authenticate the request. By default
(\code{NULL}), no authentication is performed.}

\item{security_args}{An optional list of arguments to the \code{security_fn}
function.}

\item{response_parser}{A function to parse the server response (\code{resp}).
Defaults to \code{\link[httr2:resp_body_raw]{httr2::resp_body_json()}}, since JSON responses are common. Set
this to \code{NULL} to return the raw response from \code{\link[httr2:req_perform]{httr2::req_perform()}}.}

\item{response_parser_args}{An optional list of arguments to pass to the
\code{response_parser} function (in addition to \code{resp}).}

\item{next_req}{An optional function that takes the previous response
(\code{resp}) to generate the next request in a call to
\code{\link[httr2:req_perform_iterative]{httr2::req_perform_iterative()}}. This function can usually be generated
using \code{\link[httr2:iterate_with_offset]{httr2::iterate_with_offset()}}, \code{\link[httr2:iterate_with_offset]{httr2::iterate_with_cursor()}}, or
\code{\link[httr2:iterate_with_offset]{httr2::iterate_with_link_url()}}.}

\item{max_reqs}{The maximum number of requests to perform. Use \code{Inf} to
perform all requests until \code{next_req()} returns \code{NULL}.}

\item{user_agent}{A string to identify where this request is coming from.
It's polite to set the user agent to identify your package, such as
"MyPackage (https://mypackage.com)".}
}
\value{
The response from the API, parsed by the \code{response_parser}.
}
\description{
This function implements an opinionated framework for making API calls. It is
intended to be used inside an API client package. It serves as a wrapper
around the \code{req_} family of functions, such as \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}}, as well as
\code{\link[httr2:req_perform]{httr2::req_perform()}} and \code{\link[httr2:req_perform_iterative]{httr2::req_perform_iterative()}}, and, by default,
\code{\link[httr2:resp_body_raw]{httr2::resp_body_json()}}.
