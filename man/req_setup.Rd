\title{Setup a basic API request}
\usage{
req_setup(base_url, ..., user_agent = "nectar (https://nectar.api2r.org)")
}
\arguments{
\item{base_url}{The part of the url that is shared by all calls to the API.
In some cases there may be a family of base URLs, from which you will need
to choose one.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{user_agent}{A string to identify where this request is coming from.
It's polite to set the user agent to identify your package, such as
"MyPackage (https://mypackage.com)".}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.
}
\description{
For a given API, the \code{base_url} and \code{user_agent} will almost always be the
same. Use this function to prepare that piece of the request once for easy
reuse.
}
\examples{
req_setup("https://example.com")
req_setup(
  "https://example.com",
  user_agent = "my_api_client (https://my.api.client)"
)
}
